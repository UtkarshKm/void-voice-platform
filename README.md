## 📦 Quick Start

To get Void Voice up and running locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

  * Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn/bun
  * MongoDB database (MongoDB Atlas recommended for ease of setup)
  * Google AI API key (for AI suggestions)

### 1\. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/void-voice.git
cd void-voice
bun install  # or npm install
```

### 2\. Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and populate it with the following:

```env
# Database
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/void-voice

# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-min-32-chars

# AI
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your-google-gemini-api-key

# App
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

#  Email (for verification)
RESEND_API_KEY=your-resend-api-key

```

-----

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://www.google.com/search?q=%5Bhttps://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts%5D\(https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts\)) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel (if applicable to your project setup).

## 🌐 Deployment

### Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Push to GitHub first:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial deployment"
git push origin main
```

Then, import your GitHub repository at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com).
Set the required **Production Environment Variables** in the Vercel dashboard.
Deploy automatically\!

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

### Production Environment Variables

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://...
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-production-secret
RESEND_API_KEY=your-production-secret
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your-api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
```
